const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
// Define the store here:

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

/* 

The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.

Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.

Note: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers this topic.
