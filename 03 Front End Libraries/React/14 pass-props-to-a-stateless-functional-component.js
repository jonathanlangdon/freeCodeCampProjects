When rendering CurrentDate from the Calendar component, pass in a property of date assigned to the current date from JavaScript's Date object. Then access this prop in the CurrentDate component, showing its value within the p tags. Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance date={Date()}. */
