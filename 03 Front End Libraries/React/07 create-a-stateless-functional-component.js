const MyComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div>String of Text</div>
  )
}

/* 
The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.
